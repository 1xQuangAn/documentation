This page is a placeholder for documentation in the works.

It's not something you usually see from the Pantheon Docs team, and maybe you're just as surprised as we are.

There's no `under-construction.gif`, but check back soon.

In the meantime, try the [Manually Migrate](/guides/drupal-9-migration/migrate-manual-d9) part of this guide to get your existing Drupal 8 code onto a fresh, new Drupal 9 site.

<!-- Checking out our comments too? Alright!

This overview outlines the steps perform a guided, in-place upgrade of an existing Pantheon-hosted Drupal 8 site to Drupal 9 using the Pantheon Dashboard.
